            <p>-The scoring system is based on how well you execute each move. The closer you get to the move on screen
                the more points you will get !</p>
            <p>-Throughout the song your score is added to the total to the top left of the webcam. This is not saved
                anywhere so please keep track of this so it dont disappear at the end of the game. Idk what happens we
                haven't got that far yet.</p>
            <p>-The countdown currently just counts down from 10 and then the user has to do the pose when the countdown
                reaches 0.</p>
            <p>-When uploading your own song just let jesus take the wheel idk how when gonna finish any of that shit in
                time ngl but we will give it a try.</p>
